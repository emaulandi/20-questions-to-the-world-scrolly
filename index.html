					<p>20 Questions to the World is a human-based video documentary which aims at better understanding our world and fostering a sense of global community.</p>

				<div class="before-subtile"></div>

				<h2> How it all started </h2>

					<p>It all started with a simple and yet complex question : How to understand the world? It is so easy to be either fascinated or deeply worried about the way our world is evolving. We are polluting it like there’s no tomorrow, but at the same time more and more people have access to safe food and water. There has never been so few conflicts worldwide but extremist parties are rising all around the globe.</p>
					<p>How to get a big and true picture of what’s happening? How to know what or who to believe? That was my main questions.</p>
					<p>The answer of 20 Questions to the World has been to go and ask questions to people. How to better understand the world? By understanding the people. How to understand the people? By asking them questions. We thus created a questionnaire of 20 very open questions about education, the future, happiness, religion that we asked to people all around the world.</p>

				<div class="before-subtile"></div>

				<h2> The journey </h2>

					<p>Since 2016, we keep asking those same 20 open questions to hundreds of people worldwide, of more than 80 nationalities and very distinct social backgrounds.</p>
					<p>To you, what is the main characteristic that all human beings have in common ? / Is your life easier or more complicated than your parents&#x27; life? … Those and 18 others questions we asked to better understand what binds us and what differentiates us.</p>
					<p>See the first journey we took :</p>

					<p>Based on the 10,000+ answers that we have already collected, we share fresh and inspiring video content showing a great diversity of opinions.  The first conclusion of this journey is that we are much more human than we think.</p>
					<p>Built from this experience, our goal is to foster a feeling of global empathy, a necessary step to solve our global problems. We also work on artistic concepts like a video cabin and a book to creatively share our messages.</p>
					<p>Not convinced yet ? Yes, it might sounds a bit hazy like that. But once you really sit to listen to humans different from yourself, you can see this. We bring back those moments :</p>

							<p>So here are our 437 interviewed people. Let&#x27;s look more closely who they are.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-index=1 data-step=highlight>
							<p>Let’s look at few people TBD</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-index=1 data-step=close-highlight>

					</div>
					<div class='step' data-index=1 data-step=gender>
							<p>We met almost as much as Women than Men ...</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-index=2 data-step=age>
							<p>… they were from all ages, and mostly between 25 and 35 years old.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-index=3 data-step=kids>
							<p>Most people don’t have kids (a bunch of them are kids themselves), and usually have at least 2 kids.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-index=4 data-step=population>
							<p>We try to interview people from all city size (even in the desert !). But we also met a lot of people in larger cities.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-index=5 data-step=occupation>
							<p>They all come from very different walks of life. From the lawyer to the homeless, from the student to the politician. Liberal profession were overall greatly represented.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-index=6 data-step=gather>
							<p>Now explore for yourself ! Click on circle to see who’s hiding there :) click again on the bigger circle to go on (one person at the time is better).</p>

					<p>Now you have a better overview of all the people that were meet on this journey. Keep posted, we are working on the second part of this article focusing on people’s answers. Are people more optimistic about the future ? What do they fear ? What are their dreams ? Is there any trends here ?</p>
					<p>And we will also look at answers representation across characteristics, such as age and city population. Far from being a scientific study, it will be an interesting exploration, only a start to question our views and our world.</p>
					<p>But because people are much more than data and categories, start the exploration by browsing videos :</p>
